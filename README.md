# Website-Blocker

the working of this program is that, windows contain a file name 'hosts' in the directory C:/windows/system32/drivers/etc which can be used to redirect a particular website to 
a particular IP address, this program adds the website and the IP address added is of the own local PC or say- 'localhost' hence, when you try to open a blocked website, there's
an error of DNS server can't respond.
